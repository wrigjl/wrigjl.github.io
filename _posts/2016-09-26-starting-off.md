I'm an amateur (heavy emphasis on amateur) astronomer.  I thought it
might be interesting to blob about my observations, my equipment, and
otherwise document my endeavors.

I guess I’ll start with the things that make observing possible for me.
There are several helpful books: two by H. A. Rey (you probably know him
as the author of the Curious George books), and another by
Guy Consolmagno and Dan M. Davis.

First the H. A. Rey books. Let’s start with
"[Find The Constellations](https://www.amazon.com/Find-Constellations-H-Rey/dp/054713178X)". This
book is primarily for children. It gives the names of the
constellations and the stories behind them.  I’ve been sharing this
book with my daughters now for years a little bit at a time. The
illustrations are clear and the language is perfect for read-a-long.
"[The Stars](https://www.amazon.com/Stars-H-Rey/dp/0547132808)"
by H. A. Rey is the adult analog of “Find The Constellations”. It
covers all of the material in the previous book, but goes into much
greater depth and includes hourly charts. The last third of the book
gives a well written and detailed description of the apparent motion
of the stars and the mechanics behind it.

The final book, and my personal favorite is
“[Turn Left at Orion](https://www.amazon.com/Turn-Left-Orion-Hundreds-Telescope/dp/0521153972)”
by Guy Consolmagno and Dan M. Davis. One of the reviewers of this book
said that it should come with every beginner telescope: I agree. The
authors concentrate on smaller telescopes (2-4 inch, 5-10cm) and
describe how to find interesting things in the sky and when they will
be visible. Further, the illustrations show you what to look for with
you naked eye, what to find in the finderscope, and finally what you
can expect to see in the telescope itself.

In the house, before going outside, I tend to use the H. A. Rey books
to show my daughters what we’re going to see and how we’re going to
find it.  Outside, I take my red flashlight and a copy of “Turn Left
at Orion” and that stays near the telescope.

Tonight, the girls and I watched
[Stargazers #16-39](http://www.stargazersonline.org/episodes/1639.html)
which describes how to find Cygnus the swan.  I had no trouble
locating it after figuring out the three stars in the summer triangle:
Vega, Deneb, and Altair.  Vega was almost directly over head at 8:30pm
local which was a big help. Deneb, it turns out, is the back of the
swan and the eye of the swan is a double-star called Albireo.  My
daughters had a bit more trouble finding Cygnus, but we’ll keep
working on it.

My wife arrived home and the girls were anxious to show her what
they’ve learned over the past few weeks.  They showed her how to use
the “Big Dipper’s” pointer stars to find Polaris (North Star), how to
hop from Polaris to Cassiopeia and finally hop from Cassiopeia to the
great square (part of Pegasus).  This star hopping pattern was
described in
[Stargazers #16-38](http://www.stargazersonline.org/episodes/1638.html).

Then we pulled out my old telescope (a Meade 4500, a 113mm/4.5″
reflector on an equatorial mount I bought about 20 years ago).  I
found [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdkB5NCnFps) today
which describes how to align a German equatorial mount very
helpful. He describes locking the right ascension and declination
controls in a particular position and then using the altitude
(latitude) and azimuth (horizontal turning) adjustments to center
Polaris, first in the finder scope and then in the telescope itself.
After you lock the altitude and azimuth controls and unlock the right
ascension and declination controls, you’re ready to roll!

Using just the 20mm eyepiece, I located Albireo and showed everyone
how to “split” a double.  The two stars of Albireo are of strikingly
different color, so it makes for a good target.  We also turned the
telescope on [NGC457](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_457), an open
cluster in Cassiopeia.  I believe the mirror in the 4500 might be too
far gone for deep sky observing as we could not make out much of it.
Maybe tomorrow we’ll put the Meade DS2114 (a newer 4.5″ reflector) in
the equatorial mount and see what we can see.

The girls also spotted 8 satellites, 7 airplanes, and the Milky Way.
Early on things were a bit cloudy, but by the time we were actually
observing the skies cleared and seeing was wonderful.

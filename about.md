I'm Jason L. Wright and I'm a kernel developer with experience in the OpenBSD,
FreeBSD, and Linux kernels.  I'm also the owner of
[Thought Networks](http://www.thought.net).
I've written device drivers of just about
every sort (serial, parallel, IDE, USB, ATA, etc.) and bus (ISA, EISA,
PCI, SBus, VME).  I'm also an amateur astronomer and amateur radio
operator (AI4JW).
